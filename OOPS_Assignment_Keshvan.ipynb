        "**Q1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "**Ans:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in computer programming that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. The five key concepts of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is like wrapping up data and methods into a single unit, called a class. It allows you to hide the internal details and expose only what’s necessary. Think of it as a protective shield that keeps the data safe from outside interference and misuse. For example, a car's engine is encapsulated; you don't need to know how it works to drive the car.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction:** Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. It focuses on the essential qualities of an object rather than the specific details. It's like a blueprint of a house; you know the rooms and layout without needing to know the exact number of bricks used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:** Inheritance allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, promoting code reusability. It’s like a child inheriting traits from their parents. For example, if you have a Vehicle class, a Car class can inherit properties like wheels and engine from Vehicle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function or method to work in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon. For instance, a draw() method could be used to draw different shapes like circles or squares, depending on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Association, Aggregation, and Composition:** These are relationships between objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Association: A general relationship between objects, where one object uses or interacts with another.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Aggregation: A special type of association where one object is a part of another but can exist independently (e.g., a department and its professors).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Composition: A stronger form of aggregation where one object cannot exist without the other (e.g., a house and its rooms)."

This triggers name mangling, which makes it harder (but not impossible) to access these attributes or methods from outside the class. This approach provides a way to encapsulate and protect data while still allowing flexibility in how it's accessed and modified."

This can create ambiguity because the derived class could inherit the same method or attribute from multiple paths in the inheritance hierarchy. The name \"Diamond Problem\" comes from the diamond shape formed when you draw out the inheritance diagram.\n",

This ensures that each class in the inheritance hierarchy is only considered once, in a consistent and predictable order. The MRO determines which method or attribute will be inherited when there are multiple possibilities, thereby preventing ambiguity and ensuring that the most specific implementation is used."
